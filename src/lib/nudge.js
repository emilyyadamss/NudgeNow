/* The nudge engine.

   Two independent signals, blended by a weight you control in Settings:

     recency  — how long since you last touched it, on a saturating curve so
                "12 days" and "40 days" both read as very stale without one
                ancient goal permanently monopolising the nudge.
     deficit  — how far under target you are over a rolling window the length
                of the goal's own cadence. Unit-free, so hours and projects
                and pages compete fairly.

   score = w·recency + (1−w)·deficit, and the highest score gets nudged.

   Goals in revisit are scored on a third signal entirely — see below. */
